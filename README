 * Task:
 * 
 * When first time launch - authenticate with Facebook:
 * 
 * Launch native Facebook application if installed, or a web application in a
 * popup window otherwise
 * 
 * Get a token. If failed, show a message and ask for another try or close the
 * application
 * 
 * User should be able to register on Facebook if he doesn't have an account
 * 
 * The user should not enter the application without athenticating on Facebook.
 * 
 * Load the user's data from Facebook to the database (first/last name,
 * birthday, photo, etc). The user information should be updated on the main
 * activity. The token should be stored in the local application storage.
 * 
 * If the user is already authenticated - pass this step and show the main
 * activity with his data stored in the database.
 * 
 * All Facebook API calls and other time consuming actions should be made in a
 * separate thread. The UI should never be blocked.
 * 
 * All asynchronous calls should be easily cancelled by tapping on 'Back' button
 * on the device and the process should be terminated normally (no any hung
 * threads).
 * 
 * Add logging when needed.
 * 
 * There's no need to update user's information on each start, only on the first
 * login.
 * 
 * Add Logout button to signout and exit from the application.
 * 
 * All API calls should work with bad or slow Internet connection. No hangouts
 * in no way. If there's no any connection - tell the user that he should find
 * one.
