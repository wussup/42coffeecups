 * Task:
 * 
 * Add a new tab called 'Friends'. The first tab 'Main' should contain the
 * original user's information. The second tab 'Friends' should show a list of
 * friends on Facebook with an avatar, first and last name. The third tab is
 * 'About'.
 * 
 * By clicking on a list item the Facebook app or a web application should be
 * opened with the selected friend.
 * 
 * The list of friends should be scrolled very smoothly without any delays no
 * matter how much data it contains.
 * 
 * As always - all time consuming actions should not hang out the application
 * and the UI should always be responsible as much as possible. If there's no
 * connection or connection is silly - the user should know, the application
 * shall not fail silently.
 * 
 * Add a splash screen while loading the friends list.
 * 
 * Don't forget about proper logging.
